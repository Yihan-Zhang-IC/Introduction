## Hardware Engineering for the Next Generation

!!!UNDER MAINTENANCE!!! - Coming up soon!
-- Revision 6

In the past decades, [Moore's Law](http://www.computer-architecture.org/textual/Moore-Cramming-More-Components-1965.pdf) guided the semiconductor industry with its prediction of a **steady growth** in computing power at a fixed unit cost.
However, in recent years, this stability has started to decline. 
While smaller and more efficient transistors will continue to emerge, each step toward miniaturization requires new device structures and materials. From [high-k metal gate (HKMG)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4418914/) and [FinFET](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6242496) to [gate-all-around (GAA)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614629) and [complementary FET (CFET)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8510618) in the future, each advancement encounters novel **uncertainties**, especially when compared to the golden days of [Dennard scaling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1050511), that allows us to rely on yearly improvements in electronics.

Aware of the potential economic impact of this decreasing stability, I have directed my research on a "more-than-Moore" approach.
Although the golden era may have passed, it left us with a range of compact and energy-efficient transistors for information processing.
I concentrate my current research on circuits operating in the nW/sub-nW range, tapping into their significant potential to function under innovative power sources.
In other words, **I aim to apply my integrated circuit (IC) engineering skills to make the unseen useful**.
I hope my research path will help the IC industry find a new way to achieve stable growth again.
